# AwSW-Post-True-Aftermath-Lorem-edition

NOTE: This requires MagmaLink to work, which can be found on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink), or on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594080243)

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This mod is based off the original Post True and Aftermath mods. Both of which take place after the true ending, and show what happened to each of the main characters after the true ending. Except for Lorem.
And this mod aims to fill in those gaps, by giving Lorem their own Post True and Aftermath inspired route.

I tried my best to make this mod as accurate/loyal to the original mods as possible, but due to differences in writing/ideas, it won't be a perfect fit.

Another thing I want to make clear, is that I don’t take any ownership, or credit for the original mods, and encourage you to check them out for yourself:

Aftermath (By Amaletz): https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/discussions/18446744073709551615/3277925755448602086/?appid=571880

This mod includes:
+ Post-True ending content for Lorem
+ A semi-randomized minigame
+ And 4 different endings

Requirements:
Do 4 of Lorem’s dates, and get impressed status, then do the true ending route.
